              Before every appointment, our AI system automatically checks your insurance coverage for the specific 
              service you're scheduled to receive. You'll see a detailed breakdown of expected coverage, including 
              estimated out-of-pocket costs, how much counts toward your deductible, and any co-pays or co-insurance. 
              If a service might not be covered, you'll receive an alert before your appointment so you can make an 
              informed decision.

              Yes! Cost estimates are provided automatically when you schedule an appointment. The estimate factors in 
              your specific insurance benefits, remaining deductible, provider rates, and typical costs for your 
              particular service. You can view these estimates at any time from your dashboard. For more complex 
              procedures or treatments, you can request a detailed estimate that breaks down all potential costs.
